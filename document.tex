  There are over 1,400 cryptocurrencies and 180 fiat currencies in
  the world today. Many governments around the world are proving to be
  unstable, and this has pushed consumers to flock towards Bitcoin and the
  multitude of alternate cryptocurrencies, which have rapidly grown in their
  popularity in recent years. These alternative currencies have served as the
  training grounds for what will soon be the One World Currency, which is
  coming soon â€“ GODcoin.\\

  In short, GODcoin will be the perfect currency, because it is the currency
  of Christ. It will be the currency of His new Government, which will be
  established very soon, and it will eliminate all other currencies, leaving
  it to be the only formally accepted form of money.\\

  Early investors have the opportunity to secure their wealth for the future
  ahead, so the time to invest is now or wait until after the ICO investment
  phase, when GODcoin becomes the common currency for wages throughout the world
  and the opportunity to profit through early investment will no longer be
  present.

  \section{Introduction}
  \textbf{GODcoin has the edge in security, because unlike other currencies, it
  is \textit{backed by Gold and Silver}, which will ensure stability. This
  carries additional incentives, such as \textit{lower fees, faster transaction
  times, and energy efficiency.}}\\

  Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been successful examples in
  creating a distributed network that users could trust, and many of these
  currencies have experienced a tremendous increase in value, regardless of
  having no backing. It has marked a significant beginning to the digital
  currency world that users can trust, becoming what many have called \"digital
  gold\". However, the market for Bitcoin is still volatile, leaving
  consumers susceptible to absurd fluctuations in its value. GODcoin will solve
  this issue by being backed by physical assets. Because these assets cannot be
  fabricated out of thin air, GODcoin will allow us to maintain a stable
  economy, while providing citizens with a currency that keeps pace with the
  latest technological advancements, all controlled as a fiat issued by
  Christ.\\

  GODcoin will be simple, efficient, and a secure form of digital currency. The
  blockchain is open allowing for full transparency and tamper resistance. As a
  centralized cryptocurrency controlled by Christ, we no longer require a
  consensus algorithm, allowing for drastic energy savings.\\

  Decentralized networks represent mob rule. This leads to anarchy and
  instability, as we have seen through the hundreds of cryptocurrencies in
  existence competing for a place on the market. GODcoin will be operated by
  Christ as the authoritarian figure of our cryptocurrency and will be the sole
  economy of the New Kingdom.\\

  The GODcoin blockchain will contain two virtual assets with the names of gold
  and silver. These virtual assets will be backed by physical gold and silver,
  ensuring a stable market, rather than a volatile market.

  \section{Problems With The Old}
  The current financial system has its fair share of issues technologically and
  economically. Governments and large cooperations betrayed the public by
  illegally manipulating the economy for their own profits. As a result, the
  people of the world are suffering.

  \subsection{Financial System Issues}
  Governments and consumers around the world are in debt. This fact cannot be
  ignored. The current system relies on consumerism to continue working. Without
  the hardworking individuals constantly purchasing goods the entire economy
  will crash leaving us with an unstable economy.\\

  Governments raise minimum wages in order to compensate for inflation in the
  prices of goods. The underlying issue with the economy is still there and this
  creates a bigger bubble. When the bubble pops, everyone suffers.\\

  The current fiat system has been corrupted and manipulated by government
  officials. Government officials may take bribes for their own profit or to
  increase their power and control at the expense of the public. This abuse
  erodes the trust of the people.\\

  The current system is manipulatable by criminals. From money laundering to
  check forgery the technology to prevent fraud is an ongoing battle that must
  always be won in order to be successful. Specialists in fraud detection need
  to be employed and the costs are enormous.\\

  Money is backed on trust rather than real value. When trust is lost in the
  system, the value of the currency goes down and everyone suffers. If the
  currency was stable, there would be no room for markets to crash.\\

  Transaction fees are expensive. The fees increase when currencies need to be
  exchanged to send money to another part of the world. This lack of uniformity
  is an unnecessary burden in the world.

  \subsection{Limitations Of Current Cryptocurrencies}
  Cryptocurrency is too difficult for the average consumer to understand and
  use. A long way has come in the ergonomics for the end user, but it is still
  not perfect yet. This prevents adoption of the technology and merchants may
  find it a waste of time to integrate.\\

  End users have a difficult time choosing which cryptocurrency to use and
  merchants have a harder time arriving at that decision. In these cases,
  merchants tend to use a centralized payment processor that may accept multiple
  cryptocurrencies for the consumers convenience.\\

  Many cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, use Proof-of-Work which is an enormous
  waste of resources. A Bitcoin specialist has determined it takes over an
  estimated 2.5 gigawatts of electricity to mine Bitcoin.\\

  Decentralized cryptocurrencies are poor to scale. Bitcoin reaches around 7
  transactions per second and takes a long time to confirm. Blocks are produced
  around ten minutes, resulting in slow confirmation times and a poor consumer
  experience.\\

  Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized or ruled by the mob. We have seen
  unnecessary drama around the many forks of various blockchains. For an economy
  to successfully work around the globe, we need a strong central figure.

  \section{New World Economy}
  GODcoin will be the economy of the New Kingdom ordained by Christ. It will be
  the only currency left standing once His Kingdom starts. His incorruptible
  Government will be managing GODcoin. Faith and trust will be restored to the
  people as it should be.

  \subsection{Hard Asset Backing}
  GODcoin is backed by gold and silver. Each token will be backed by the
  appropriate hard asset backing and assigned a specific weight. This weight
  will be unchangeable, resulting in a stable coin that cannot be fabricated out
  of thin air.\\

  Gold will be better suited for higher value transactions. Likewise silver will
  be better suited for micro or smaller value transactions.

  \subsection{Combining The Old With The New}
  As we have seen, GODcoin uses gold and silver to represent the new economy. Of
  course, people cannot be carrying precious metals everywhere they go and paper
  money is forgeable. This is a major hassle to do so and that is why we are
  using cryptocurrency as the platform of choice to interact with the GODcoin
  economy.\\

  GODcoin has digital tokens for gold and silver. The convenience of the modern
  era increases the ergonomics for utilizing our platform. Cryptography is used
  to ensure the authenticity of the transaction to prevent manipulation.

  \section{Technology}
  GODcoin uses blockchain technology for our digital platform. The blockchain is
  tamper resistant allowing its history to be fully archivable as well as
  verifiable. Any node operator will be able to synchronize the blockchain to
  validate past and future blocks with their associated transactions.
  Multi-signature wallets and smart contracts will be supported using a simple
  scripting language.\\

  \subsection{Centralized}
  An economy requires a strong authority to thrive properly. GODcoin is ordained
  by Christ and will be the central economy of the New Kingdom. This has
  inherent properties as consensus is no longer required thereby saving enormous
  resources and allows for other optimizations available to a standard server to
  client model.

  \subsection{Security}
  Blockchains inherently need to be a fortress. All transactions are signed to
  prove the authenticity of the owner to perform an action on the blockchain.
  GODcoin will support multi-signature wallets and smart contracts where higher
  levels of security are necessary.\\

  It is mandatory for the master node to use a multi-signature cold wallet and a
  separate private key only for block production.

  \subsection{Transparency}
  Blockchains are naturally sequential and contain all the necessary data that
  pertains to the system. This allows us to easily distribute the block log
  without worrying about additional metadata. Any node operators will be able to
  synchronize the log and be able to remain in sync as new blocks arrive.

  \subsection{Minting}
  Blocks will be produced through a process called minting. This process can
  only occur by use of a master node. The GODcoin team will be the only master
  node on the network.\\

  Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies with block rewards, GODcoin does not
  partake in the creation of tokens unless explicitly created by a master node
  during minting a new block. This is a necessary step to ensure that we never
  overcommit circulating tokens, in this way we never exceed our physical asset
  reserves.

  \subsection{Fees}
  Fees will be paid respective to the asset that is being transferred or the
  asset the transaction type expects. The fee rate may differ between the assets
  and will be paid in their respective asset. Gold transfers will pay the fee in
  gold respectively and likewise for silver. Any fees collected will be rewarded
  to the minters.\\

  Transaction fee costs start with a minimum fee. For every additional
  transaction accepted within the block window the minimum fee is exponentially
  multiplied by the number of transactions accepted from the applicable address.
  The fee costs will reset back to the minimum fee after the block window is
  reset. The block window is reset when transactions are halted on the address
  for a period of time.\\

  In addition to the address fee mentioned in the above paragraph, there is an
  associated \say{global} network fee. The network fee works in the same way as
  the address based fee and protects the network from flooding via multiple
  addresses. The global fee is dynamically adjusted based on network usage.\\

  This quickly gets expensive for an attacker attempting to Denial-of-Service
  (DoS) the network, but allows flexibility for a normal user when waiting for
  the block window to reset back to the minimum fee is not an option.\\

  Sample based on transferring funds using any asset with a minimum fee of
  0.00000500 coins with a 2.00000000 multiplier:

  \vspace{3mm}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lr@{}}
    Fees & Block Height     \\ \toprule
    0.00000500 & 10         \\
    0.00001000 & 11         \\
    0.00002000 & 12         \\
    0.00000500 & $\leftarrow{}$ block window reset $\rightarrow{}$ 20 \\ \midrule{}
    Total Fees & 0.00004000 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}

  \subsection{Transaction Signatures}
  A signature is used to confirm the authenticity of the owner or owners
  of a particular message or document.\\

  All transactions will be signed either directly or when a block is produced
  and gets signed by the minter. \textit{Ed25519}\cite{ed25519} will be used for
  the digital signing algorithm. Ed25519 is a modern signing algorithm, it
  provides a similar protection level to NIST P-256 and has fast verification
  times with small signatures. Running a full node on a mobile device may very
  well be possible, the limiting factor may be the storage on a given device.\\

  Ed25519 has fewer attack vectors, such as resistance to side-channel attacks
  and attacks from poor random number generator implementations. While
  non-deterministic algorithms can suffer from hardware fault attacks, it is
  extremely difficult to successfully execute. Even with a server running
  without \gls{ecc-memory} the attack isn't practical in any way over the
  internet.

  \newpage
  \section{Conclusion}
  GODcoin will be the only digitally tradable currency backed by hard assets,
  and will soon be issued as the currency of the New World Order. The Lord has
  declared that the gold and silver are His, and in His New Kingdom, only
  through obedience to Him will anyone be allowed to prosper. In Revelation
  3:18, the Lord instructs you to buy gold from Him. He says this because very
  soon there will be no other authorized currency in circulation, so everyone
  will eventually have to accept it, just as they do with other forms of money
  today. Those who wisely buy GODcoin early will amass greater wealth as the
  value of the coin increases, however, those who do not take heed to His
  instructions, will face significant financial hardship in the future.\\

  Many predictions were made regarding the future coming of a New World
  Currency, including this one from the cover of a 1988 edition of \textit{The
  Economist}\cite{the-economist}, where it was strongly hinted that it was
  planned to arrive soon.\\

  Because the Son of Man was born 50 years ago in 1968, this puts us at the
  beginning of the Lordâ€™s Jubilee Year, the year when Lord Ra-El must take his
  throne, and issue the One World Currency.\\

  The time is now to affirm your place of wealth in the New Kingdom, and take
  part in GODcoin, the only true currency ordained by God, and issued by the
  Messiah, Lord Ra-El.\\
